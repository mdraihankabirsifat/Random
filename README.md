# 🧠 Competitive Programming Repository

Welcome to my personal **Competitive Programming (CP)** repository.  
This is a private collection of my practice and contest codes, covering a wide range of topics, platforms, and problem difficulties.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal archive of solved problems from online judges (Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, Vjudge etc.)
- A tracker for my progress and learning in competitive programming
- A reference for revisiting problem-solving techniques and patterns

## 🛠️ Tools and Languages

- **Language:** Primarily C/C++
- **Editor:** VS Code
- **Compiler:** g++ with C++17/C++20 support
- **Testing:** Manual test cases or input/output files

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Sorting & Searching  
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS etc.)  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Number Theory  
- Binary Search  
- Bitmasking  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Segment Trees  
- Geometry and more...

## 🚧 Notes

> ⚠️ This is a **private repository** for personal use and learning purposes.  
> Solutions may not be optimized or commented thoroughly.  
> Many codes are written under time pressure during contests.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a CSE student at BUET with a strong interest in algorithms and problem solving.  
This repository is a reflection of my journey in competitive programming.
