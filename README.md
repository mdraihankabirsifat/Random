# 💻 Code Odyssey | Daily CP & CSE Journey

Welcome! This is a public repository where I archive my daily journey through Computer Science and Engineering. It tracks my transition from competitive programming practice to versatile academic and personal development.

## 📂 Repository Breakdown

The code is organized into specific modules to track different aspects of my learning:

### 🏆 Competitive Programming
* **Problem Sets:** Solved problems from online judges like Codeforces, AtCoder, and LeetCode.

### 🎓 Academic Work
* **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Core implementations of BSTs, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
* **Course Assessments:** Solutions for academic "Online" and "Offline" programming tasks.
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Projects and assignments focused on OOP principles.

### 🛠️ Tools & Personal Library
* **Personal Functions:** A collection of reusable snippets and utility functions.
* **Projects:** Larger development projects and experimental builds.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Primary Language:** C++ (with C++17/20 support).
* **Environment:** VS Code.
* **Core Focus:** Turning logical puzzles into efficient code.

## 📚 Topics Covered

* Sorting & Searching
* Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, etc.)
* Dynamic Programming & Number Theory
* Segment Trees & Greedy Algorithms
* Bitmasking & Binary Search

## 🚧 Notes

> [!NOTE]
> This is a public repository for personal use and growth tracking. 
> Some codes were written under time pressure during live contests, while others are structured implementations for academic requirements.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a CSE student at BUET with a strong interest in algorithms and problem-solving. I enjoy learning new things and adopting them in real-life experiences.
