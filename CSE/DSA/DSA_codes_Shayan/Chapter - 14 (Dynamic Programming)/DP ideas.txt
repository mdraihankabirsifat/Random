Types of DP till now:
1) Counting ways DP (Basically a mathematical formula
    with overlapping steps solved efficiently): Fibonacci, Grid paths

2) Subarray DP(result of two subarrays can be merged, 
    choose the best in a range [i, j]) : MCM

3) Take or not take / Subsequence DP : LCS, knapsack 0 / 1

4) Comparison DP(the last element(generally) matters) : LIS
